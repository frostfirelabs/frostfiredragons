            <h2>Understanding an f1 car</h2>
            <p>Formula 1 cars are engineering marvels, designed for maximum speed, precision handling, and aerodynamic efficiency. Every component‚Äîfrom the engine to the tires‚Äîplays a crucial role in delivering record-breaking lap times. Let‚Äôs break down the key elements that make an F1 car one of the fastest machines on Earth.</p>

            <h3>What fuel should I use?</h3>
            <p>Its best to use an eco friendly fuel like hydrogen, which has a long range and is clean, or bio-fuel. We recommend you to stay away from fossil fuels like diesel and petrol, as they do give performance, <span class="frost">but at the cost of the planet</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bio fuel: Eco friendly, but still involves combustion.</li>
                <li>Petrol & Diesel: Very bad for the planet, but powerful</li>
                <li>Hydrogen: The balance of power and eco friendliness, the best fuel to use if you are focusing on eco friendliness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Car Material ‚Äì Weight vs. Durability</h3>
            <p>Your material choice affects speed, strength, and handling.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Carbon Fiber ‚Äì Lightweight, durable, and high-speed performance.</li>
                <li>Aluminum Alloy ‚Äì Strong but slightly heavier.</li>
                <li>Sustainable Composite ‚Äì Best for sustainability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Aerodynamics ‚Äì Downforce vs. Drag</h3>
            <p>Optimize airflow for maximum speed and stability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adjustable Rear Wing ‚Äì More downforce for better cornering.</li>
                <li>Low-Drag Front Wing ‚Äì Reduced air resistance for acceleration.</li>
                <li>Optimized Sidepods ‚Äì Smooth airflow to boost efficiency.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tire Selection ‚Äì Grip vs. Longevity</h3>
            <p>Tires affect traction, acceleration, and race strategy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Soft Tires ‚Äì Maximum grip, fast acceleration but wear out quickly.</li>
                <li>Hard Tires ‚Äì Long-lasting but lower traction.</li>
                <li>Intermediate Tires ‚Äì Best for mixed weather conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A well-engineered F1 car maximizes speed, grip, and efficiency!</p>
