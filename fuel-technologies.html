            <h2>Understanding Fuels</h2>
            <p>The choice of fuel in Formula 1 is a critical factor influencing both performance and environmental impact. Modern F1 is pushing towards highly efficient and sustainable solutions.</p>

            <h3>Hybrid V6 Turbo (Current Standard)</h3>
            <p>This is the current power unit in Formula 1. It combines a 1.6-liter turbocharged V6 internal combustion engine with powerful Electrical Recovery Systems (ERS) that harvest energy from braking and exhaust heat. While it still uses fossil fuels, the hybrid component significantly improves fuel efficiency and reduces overall emissions compared to older F1 engines. F1 aims for 100% sustainable fuels by 2026, transitioning this power unit.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Performance:** Extremely high power output, complex energy management.</li>
                <li>**Sustainability:** Improving, with targets for fully sustainable fuels.</li>
                <li>**Cost:** Very high operational costs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sustainable Biofuel / e-fuel</h3>
            <p>These are synthetic fuels made from non-fossil sources (e.g., sustainable biomass, captured carbon dioxide, or green hydrogen). The goal is to be 'net-zero' carbon, meaning the carbon emitted during combustion is balanced by the carbon captured during production. These fuels can be a "drop-in" replacement for traditional petrol, allowing existing engine technology to continue with a significantly reduced environmental footprint.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Performance:** Potential to match or exceed traditional fuels.</li>
                <li>**Sustainability:** Net-zero carbon potential, significantly reduced emissions.</li>
                <li>**Cost:** Currently high production costs, expected to decrease with scale.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advanced Electric Power</h3>
            <p>This represents a fully electric powertrain, similar to Formula E. While offering zero direct emissions on track, the overall environmental impact depends on the electricity source. The challenge for F1 would be battery size and weight to provide sufficient power and range for a full race distance without compromising performance or safety.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Performance:** High torque, zero direct emissions on track.</li>
                <li>**Sustainability:** Dependent on grid cleanliness, zero tailpipe emissions.</li>
                <li>**Cost:** High initial R&D for F1-level performance batteries.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hydrogen Fuel Cell</h3>
            <p>Hydrogen fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, with water as the only direct emission. It offers a very clean on-track solution. The challenges include efficient hydrogen storage (as a compressed gas or liquid), refueling infrastructure, and the energy intensity of hydrogen production itself (green hydrogen produced with renewable energy is key).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Performance:** Strong potential, but heavier systems currently.</li>
                <li>**Sustainability:** Zero direct emissions, depends on hydrogen production method.</li>
                <li>**Cost:** High infrastructure and production costs currently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These innovative fuel technologies are at the forefront of motorsport's drive towards a more sustainable future, demonstrating how high-performance racing can inspire broader automotive solutions.</p>
