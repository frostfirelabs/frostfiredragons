            <h1>About Our Website</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Frostfire Labs! We are the <strong class="frost">Frostfire Dragons</strong>, a team passionate about the thrilling world of Formula 1 and equally committed to a sustainable future. Our project for the Yasin Schools Formula Ethara 2025 competition aims to demonstrate how cutting-edge technology and environmental responsibility can converge in the pinnacle of motorsport.</p>
            <h2>About our Eco-F1 builder</h2>
            
            <h3>The Vision: Performance Meets Planet</h3>
            <p>Our core belief is that sustainability doesn't have to compromise performance. Instead, it can drive new levels of innovation and efficiency. Through this interactive tool, we invite you to explore the choices F1 teams face in designing a car that is both incredibly fast and environmentally conscious.</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>This "Eco-F1 Builder" allows you to select various components for a conceptual F1 car, each with its own impact on:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> How fast the car can go.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> The estimated financial outlay for the component.</li>
                <li><strong>Eco-Score:</strong> A simplified metric representing the component's environmental impact (e.g., embodied carbon, recyclability, emissions).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you've made your selections, our system calculates an overall Eco-Score and estimated cost for your custom car. Then, you can simulate a race against a "standard" F1 car to see how your eco-innovations perform on the track!</p>

            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>Formula 1 has a massive global platform. By showcasing and developing sustainable technologies within motorsport, we can inspire broader change in the automotive industry and raise awareness about the importance of eco-friendly engineering. Our project highlights the potential for motorsport to be a proving ground for innovations that benefit us all, helping to build a more sustainable future, one lap at a time.</p>
           
            <h2>About Our F1 Aerodynamics Tester</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong class="frost">Frostfire Labs</strong>, home of the Frostfire Dragons! Our mission is to explore the science of Formula 1 aerodynamics and help enthusiasts fine-tune their virtual racing machines for peak performance. Through this interactive tester, users can experiment with <strong>downforce</strong> and <strong>drag</strong>—two critical forces shaping F1 car speed, grip, and efficiency.</p>

<h3>The Vision: Engineering Meets Precision</h3>
<p>In motorsport, tiny aerodynamic refinements can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Our tool lets users visualize airflows, adjust wing angles, and understand how small modifications affect real-world racing physics. Whether you're aiming for maximum stability or top speed, you’ll learn how to make an F1 car cut through the air like a champion.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>The <strong>F1 Aerodynamics Tester</strong> allows users to customize their car’s aerodynamic setup with adjustable parameters such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Front Wing & Rear Wing Angle:</strong> Controls the balance between grip and speed.</li>
    <li><strong>Drag Reduction System (DRS):</strong> Simulates the effect of DRS activation on acceleration.</li>
    <li><strong>Sidepod Intake Optimization:</strong> Adjusts airflow efficiency for cooling and aerodynamic stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Wind Tunnel Mode:</strong> Enlarges the testing area to analyze airflow patterns in greater detail.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once users fine-tune their settings, they can visualize how air interacts with the car, observe <strong>real-time turbulence simulations</strong>, and compare their setup against a <strong>standard F1 configuration</strong>.</p>

<h3>Optimization Tips & Ideal Ranges</h3>
<p>Understanding how aerodynamics work is key to achieving the best balance of speed, grip, and efficiency. Here are a few guidelines to help you refine your setup:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Downforce:</strong> A well-balanced F1 setup usually maintains downforce between <strong>2500–5000 N</strong>. Too much downforce increases grip but slows straight-line speed.</li>
    <li><strong>Drag:</strong> Ideally, keep drag below <strong>3000 N</strong> to ensure efficient acceleration. Adjusting wing angles and using DRS can help reduce drag.</li>
    <li><strong>Wing Angle Adjustments:</strong> Lower front and rear wing angles will reduce drag, but at the cost of grip. Experiment with small changes for the best aerodynamic efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Sidepod Intake:</strong> Enhancing the sidepod intake can boost downforce slightly while reducing drag if optimized correctly.</li>
    <li><strong>Wind Tunnel Analysis:</strong> Use Wind Tunnel Mode to examine airflow disturbances and refine your setup accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>
<p>Aerodynamics is the invisible force dictating success on the track. By experimenting with different configurations, users can gain a deeper understanding of how teams optimize their cars for high-speed racing while minimizing drag losses.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a seasoned racing fan, an aspiring engineer, or simply someone curious about speed, this lab empowers you to explore the science behind Formula 1 performance and push the limits of virtual race car design. Start testing and fine-tuning your ultimate F1 machine!</p>
